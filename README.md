# HitDelayFixMod

A forge mod for minecraft 1.8 that sets leftClickCounter to 0 after a MISS, therefore fixing the hit delay problem in 1.8.

Note about this mod:
Even though we think the behavior this mod fixes is not intended, not all people agree with this. Regardless, our mod adds "non-vanilla" behavior and could technically count as an unfair advantage. As always, use at your own risk.
